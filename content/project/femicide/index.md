The [Australian Femicide & Child Death Map](https://www.google.com.au/maps/d/viewer?mid=1WEjK9o99Qm734bKyizsOY_4XPDUgvnp2&ll=-27.545476629424474%2C135.4058944836213&z=4&fbclid=IwAR1ZmZ497DabSn3NDLK_Xhe8n63748V0njO9eUFZCoKiQzOrpwO3FmQ_DlU), created by [Sherele Moody](https://www.facebook.com/AustralianFemicideMap/), documents the stories of women or children lost to violence or neglect in Australia.

This project will use the documented data to explore and gain further insight into any spatial and temporal patterns of femicide across Australia. In addition, this project will investigate relationships between victim characteristics and other known factors surrounding their death.

The student will require good R programming skills and will be expected to learn web scraping techniques. A good grade in STATS 380 would also be an advantage.

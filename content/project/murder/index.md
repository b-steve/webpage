The recently published database [The Homicide Report](https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2019/the-homicide-report/index.html) is the first publicly searchable database of homicides in New Zealand. This project will use the data (2004--2019) to explore the any spatial and/or temporal patterns in the homicide data.

The student will require good R programming skills. A good grade in STATS 380 would be an advantage.

The recently published database [The Homicide Report](https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2019/the-homicide-report/index.html) is the first publicly searchable database of homicides in New Zealand. This project will use the data (2004--2019) to explore any spatial and temporal patterns in homicides across New Zealand. In addition, this project will investigate relationships between victim characteristics and other known factors surrounding their death.


The student will require good R programming skills and will be expected to be proficient in data cleaning techniques; a good grade in STATS 380 would be an advantage.

This project is co-supervised with [Dr Rebecca Meiring](http://www.science.auckland.ac.nz/people/profile/rebecca-meiring) from Exercise Sciences. The purpose of this project is to analyse data collected on osteoarthritis patient mobility pre- and post-joint replacement surgery to infer if patient mobility has improved.

This project will involve data cleaning, manipulation, and visualisation. In addition, the student should expect to be heavily involved in statistical model development. The project is good preparation for those students looking to go into industry. Ideally the student should have good R programming skills; a good grade in STATS 380 would also be an advantage.

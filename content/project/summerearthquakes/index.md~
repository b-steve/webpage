Earthquakes evolve through contagious mechanisms: the occurrence of one earthquake typically causes aftershocks. The timestamps of earthquakes form a point pattern in time. We can use a temporal self-exciting point processes to describe how each earthquake increases the likelihood of another event (an aftershock) occurring. However, as well as the self-excitement properties of the system there are also earthquakes naturally occurring (main events) through independent processes. This project will model the occurrences of earthquakes in time to infer the background intensity of earthquakes (main events) as well as those occurring as a direct result of another (aftershocks).

The student will require good R programming skills and be familiar with maximum likelihood estimation. A good grade in STATS 310 would be an advantage.
